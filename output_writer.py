output_writer.py
-----------------
Shared row models + JSON/CSV writers used by all three scrapers.

Three modes, one row shape
--------------------------
    --mode listing    /collections/{handle}/products.json   a collection
    --mode search     /search/suggest.json?q=…              a keyword lookup
    --mode product    /products/{handle}.js                 one product

All three yield the SAME class. The store publishes one leaf — a PRODUCT —
and a collection, a search result and a product document are three views of
it. The first two are ways of SELECTING products; the third is one product
described more fully, and here "more fully" means its VARIANTS, because the
product document carries one entry per size and colour with its own sku, its
own price and its own availability.

So `--mode product` emits one row PER VARIANT, not one row per document. A
seven-size one-piece is seven rows, which is the only shape that can answer
"is the 2X in stock" — and that is the question the product document exists
to answer: on `one-pieces`, MOST products are available in some sizes and not
others — 63 / 116 / 1 (every size / some / none) of 180 on 2026-09-18, and
64 / 115 / 1 the same evening. The split moves with stock; what does not move
is that the partial bucket is the biggest one.
`product_id` carries the product's id so the rows fold back together, and
`sku` holds the VARIANT's own SKU string because rows are variants.

Columns this site does NOT have, and the measurement behind each
--------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE.md §9: a column null on every row of every run should not exist, and
removing one needs the measurement written down so someone can put it back
with a better one. Counted 2026-09-18 over 665 products across four
collection captures, plus product documents and rendered pages:

    rating / review_count            The store uses Okendo. Its stars are
                                     `display:none` in the collection grid —
                                     0 rendered star ratings on a fully
                                     scrolled listing — and no JSON route
                                     read here carries a rating at all.
                                     Okendo's own API answers per PRODUCT,
                                     so the column would cost 180 extra
                                     third-party requests for one collection.
                                     Absent rather than null, and this is the
                                     measurement to beat if someone wants it
                                     back.

    lowest_price_30d                 0 occurrences of an EU-Omnibus 30-day-low
                                     disclosure on any market, including the
                                     EU ones. The column a sibling repo needs
                                     for `mediamarkt` has nothing to hold
                                     here.

    ean / gtin / mpn                 0 `gtin`, 0 `mpn`, 0 `barcode` values
                                     populated in any payload. The store
                                     identifies by its own product id and by
                                     a style code inside the variant sku
                                     (`AO292` of `AO292-BLK-XS`), which is
                                     `base_sku`.

Columns this site DOES have that a sibling dropped
---------------------------------------------------
`original_price` and `discount_pct` are present here, and the sibling repo
this code came from correctly drops them: that site is a full-price house
with no reduced price anywhere. This one discounts heavily — 81 of 180
one-pieces and 150 of 150 items in `/collections/sale` carry a
`compare_at_price`, at 20–75% off — so both columns earn their place.

`discount_pct` is None, never 0 and never negative, when the pair is not a
discount. Shopify lets a merchant leave a stale `compare_at_price` UNDER the
current price; read as a was-price that publishes a negative discount on a
product that is not on sale (§4).

`in_stock` is a real column, and `null` is not `False`
-------------------------------------------------------
Worth stating loudly, because which ENDPOINT a run reads decides whether the
column exists at all:

    /collections/{h}/products.json   publishes `available` per variant
    /products/{handle}.js            publishes `available` per variant
    /products/{handle}.json          publishes NO availability AT ALL

That last one is why `product_endpoint()` returns `.js` — the `.json`
document carries `price_currency` and would otherwise be the better source,
but a product run off it returns seven rows with `in_stock: null`, which is
honest and useless.

Where a payload states availability for no variant, `in_stock` stays None
rather than False: an unknown recorded as unknown (§8: never present a guess
as a fact). On a listing row it is True when ANY variant is available, which
is what "can I buy this product" means; `variants_available` and
`variants_total` beside it are what make that actionable, because a bare
`in_stock: true` hides a product down to its last size.

    `status` is the field a consumer branches on:
      complete — every requested page was fetched, or the site's own
                 pagination genuinely ran out (nothing more existed to get)
      partial  — rows were gathered, then the run stopped early
      failed   — nothing was gathered at all

    `mode` and `source` are recorded because `mode` is not implied by the
    repo: the same output prefix can hold a search run, a category run or a
    product run, and those populate different columns. diff_runs.py refuses
    a pair whose modes or sources differ. `source` is `andieswim.com` on
    every row of every run here, since all 200 markets share one host with
    the market in the path; it is kept because consumers read these columns
    by name across the family, and `locale` is the column that varies.

    `locale` is recorded for a harder reason: the store SETS prices per
    market rather than converting them, so two runs differing in it are two
    price lists rather than two observations of one.

    `extra` carries facts about the run that are not about any single row.
    A listing run uses it for the market, the resolved currency and where
    that currency was read from — and for `catalog_count`, the collection
    index's `products_count`, WITH the warning that it is not a count of
    products the storefront serves (472 against 180 measured). That warning
    travels with the number rather than living only in a README, because the
    artefact is what a reader opens six months later.

    `total_results` and `pages_available` are present in the schema and
    always None here: this store states no result count anywhere. None means
    UNKNOWN and is never read as zero — treating a missing count as zero
    would cap every run after page 1 at no pages at all.

    Unlike bbb-scraper, where the same field had to carry a warning, here it
    is good news and the sidecar says so plainly: this store applies no page
    cap. Walking the whole catalogue gave 250 + 250 + 250 + 22 = 772
    distinct handles with page 5 empty (measured 2026-09-18). A run that
    walks to the end of a collection holds the whole collection, so
    "complete" here means
    what the word ought to mean.

    `pages_failed` lists the pages that did not yield data, by number.
    `pages_completed` alone was enough only while pages were fetched strictly
    in order, where "3 of 10 completed" could only mean 1-2-3: a count is not
    a description once pages can be fetched independently and page 3 can fail
    while 4 and 5 succeed. Recording the numbers keeps the sidecar honest
    about WHICH part of the catalogue is missing, not just how much.

# the DATA (a page contributed nothing not already seen, so the listing is
# over), while the second is a property of a CSS SELECTOR and is therefore
# the weaker signal — a renamed attribute looks identical to a short
# catalogue.
#

# the site states no result count anywhere, and the one count it does
# publish (`products_count`) is not a count of products it serves. So the
# run discovers its own end from the data, and "no_new_products" is the
# normal way a healthy listing run stops.

# imposes none. It means a single-response route (`product`, `search`)

# Note "parser_found_nothing" is deliberately ABSENT. A payload the store
# served that names products and parsed to zero rows is OUR failure, not a
# complete answer, and a run that ends that way must not report `complete`
# (§20). Its exit code stays EXIT_NO_PRODUCTS — the catalogue question really
# was answered — so only the status and the stop_reason carry the distinction.
