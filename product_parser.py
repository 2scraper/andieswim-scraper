"""Extraction for andieswim.com — Andie Swim, a Shopify storefront.

This module is the site. Everything else in the repo is family core.

WHAT THIS SITE PUBLISHES, AND WHY THE PARSER READS JSON RATHER THAN MARKUP
=========================================================================

Measured 2026-09-18 from a datacenter address (Hetzner/netcup-class, no
proxy, no key), against captures kept in ../captures/andieswim/:

* `andieswim.com` is Shopify (`andie-swim-1.myshopify.com`) behind a custom
  React theme.  Every route answered **HTTP 200** — with a browser UA, with
  `curl/8.5.0`, with `python-urllib`, with a crawler UA, and with **no
  User-Agent header at all**.  Twenty rapid requests in 4.9 s: twenty 200s.
  Nothing on the read path is gated.  See README for what the paid products
  are still worth here, which is honest and small.

* A **collection page's HTML carries no product grid.**  793 KB of
  `/collections/one-pieces` holds exactly 5 distinct `/products/` links, all
  of them from recommendation widgets, and `?page=2` returns the SAME five —
  the grid is painted by a React component (`react-component=
  "VisualNavProductListPage"`) that fetches over the Storefront GraphQL API
  after load.  So an HTML-tile parser on this site would report five products
  for a 180-product collection and call it success.

* A **product page publishes no Product JSON-LD.**  One `application/ld+json`
  block on `/products/the-amalfi-flat-black-classic`, and its `@type` is
  `BreadcrumbList`.  CLAUDE.md §15 says count the blocks before writing
  either path; the count here is zero for products, so there is no
  structured-data path to write.

* What the site DOES publish, ungated, is **its own JSON** — Shopify's
  storefront endpoints, which are the same objects the theme itself consumes:

      /collections/{handle}/products.json?limit=250&page=N   listing
      /products/{handle}.js                                  detail, cents
      /products/{handle}.json                                detail, decimal
                                                             + price_currency
      /search/suggest.json?q=...                             search
      /collections.json?limit=250&page=N                     collection index

  Richer than any rendered tile: every variant with its own sku, price,
  compare-at price and availability.  CLAUDE.md §21's rule — ask what the
  front end calls before assuming a browser — answered the whole repo here.

So the engines navigate to the ENDPOINT and this module parses the JSON.  The
browser is still the transport (it is what the family's proxy, fingerprint and
Scraping Browser paths plug into), and `--mode product` additionally reads the
rendered page when asked, but the DATA is JSON on every route.

THE TRAPS, EACH MEASURED
========================

`products_count` is not a product count.  `/collections.json` reports
`one-pieces` at **472** and `all-swimwear` at **3089**, while the storefront
serves **180** and **322** respectively — and the whole store holds 772
published products, so 3089 cannot be a count of anything a visitor can
reach.  It is not a variant count either (all-swimwear has 1997 variants).
Used as a completeness target it would mark every run partial forever, so
this module records it as `catalog_count` with that warning attached and
plans nothing from it.  The honest completeness signal is the site's own
sitemap: `sitemap_products_1.xml` lists 753 product URLs and every one of
them is in `/products.json`'s 772, a strict superset with zero misses.

A bogus collection handle answers **HTTP 200 with an empty list**, not 404 —
`/collections/does-not-exist/products.json` returns `{"products":[]}`.  Only
the HTML route 404s.  So "no rows" cannot be read as "empty collection"
without checking the handle exists, which `collection_is_published()` does
against the collection index, and which is why this repo distinguishes
`unknown_collection` from `empty` in its stop reasons (§20).

Options are not positional.  `variants[].option1/2/3` are commonly Color and
Size, but the store also ships `Rate`, `Length`, `Quantity`, `SPF`,
`Pack Size`, `Strength` and `Product Size` as first or second options.
Measured over 665 products: Color 647, Size 622, Rate 13, Length 5,
Quantity 4, SPF 2, Pack Size 2.  Reading `option2` as "the size" therefore
writes a rate band into a size column on a gift card.  This module maps by
the product's own `options[].name` instead, and `smoke_test.py` pins a
product whose options are `('Rate','Color','Length')`.

Prices do not vary within a swimwear product but DO within accessories — 0 of
180 one-pieces, 13 of 85 accessories.  A listing row therefore carries
`price` (the minimum) and sets `price_varies` with `price_max` beside it
rather than silently publishing one variant's figure as the product's.

Markets are path prefixes and the prices are SET per market, not converted.
The site's own sitemap index lists **200** of them, all `en-xx`.  The same
variant, 2026-09-18: 112.00 USD · 195.00 CAD · 110.00 GBP · 175.00 AUD ·
130.00 EUR · 21600 JPY.  110 GBP is about 148 USD against a 112 USD list, so
a cross-market comparison is pricing policy, not arbitrage (§20).  Join on
`sku`, never on a label.

An HTML page on this store is TIMING-DEPENDENT and a JSON endpoint is not.
There is no HTTP redirect anywhere — `curl -L` follows zero hops on every
route — but the theme ships a client-side geolocation app that rewrites the
location to the visitor's own market after load.  Measured 2026-09-18 from a
Finnish address: `/collections/all` read at `domcontentloaded` is the bare
path and says USD; the same URL read after a full load has become
`/en-fi/collections/all` and says EUR.  Three engines that wait for different
things therefore disagree about which market an HTML page is on — which they
did, until everything this repo depends on was moved off HTML.  The JSON
routes run no JavaScript and cannot be moved that way.

Currency is never guessed.  `/collections/{h}/products.json` carries NO
currency field at all, so this module refuses to stamp one from the market
prefix — a mapping this file would have to invent.  It is read from the
site: `/products/{h}.json` publishes `variants[].price_currency`, and any
HTML page on the market publishes `Shopify.currency = {"active":"GBP",...}`.
The engines fetch one of those once per run and pass it in; a run that could
not read one writes `currency: null` and says so (§8).

# NOTE: no BeautifulSoup here, and the absence is deliberate rather than an
# omission.  CLAUDE.md §4 makes `BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser")` the
# family default, and the reason it does not apply is the shape of this site:
# every field this repo publishes comes out of a JSON document, because a
# collection page's HTML carries no grid and a product page's HTML carries no
# Product JSON-LD (see the module docstring for both counts).  The only two
# things ever read out of markup are the market's currency and the store's
# 404 template, and both are single anchored patterns over a document whose
# structure is irrelevant — souping 800 KB of theme to reach them cost 74 ms
# per fetch when it was tried, measured, for nothing.  Adding a parser back
# is right the moment a field has to come from the DOM; until then it would
# be a dependency with no reader.

# Both answer, and they answer DIFFERENTLY depending on the route — measured
# 2026-09-18, after a first version of this comment got it half wrong:
#
#   www.andieswim.com/collections/one-pieces               301 -> bare host
#   www.andieswim.com/collections/one-pieces/products.json 200, stays on www.
#
# So the HTML route canonicalises and the JSON routes do not — and the JSON
# routes are the ones this repo actually fetches. Nothing breaks either way
# (both spellings serve the same payload), but it is the reason rows are
# rebuilt on CANONICAL_HOST rather than on whatever the caller typed: without
# that, two runs of the same collection would differ by a hostname in `url`
# and every row would read as changed in a diff.

# `www.` — which is not this site. Here it is the JOIN that matters, not

    1 is sold out entirely, and a listing row cannot say which — that is the
    only thing a product document adds that the listing does not already have
    at a fraction of the requests. A product run off `.json` returns seven
    rows with `in_stock: null`, which is honest and useless.

    Currency is not lost by choosing `.js`: the engines read it once per run
    from `Shopify.currency.active` on the market's own HTML, which is the
    same fact one step further from the price (§4 rung 2 rather than rung 1)
    and is what a listing run already relies on.

    The unit difference is the trap and it is handled in the parser rather
    than here: `.js` prices in integer cents, so 11200 is $112.00 and reading
    it as a decimal string publishes a $11,200 swimsuit. `payload_is_cents()`

    ORDERED BY HOW MUCH EACH SIGNAL PROVES, not by how cheap it is (§17).
    The unambiguous positive here is that the text IS one of this store's own
    JSON documents: nothing but Shopify serves `{"products": [...]}` at these
    addresses, and no interstitial or error page parses as one.  So that is
    tested first, ahead of the status and well ahead of any asset-count
    threshold — a sibling repo checked a heuristic first and reported exit 3
    for a correct answer on a page that happened to be minimal.

    An empty listing is `empty`, not `blocked`.  It is also not necessarily a
    real answer: a misspelt collection handle produces exactly the same
    document.  Telling those two apart needs the collection index, which this
    function does not have and should not fetch, so the engines do it — see
    `collection_is_published`.  What this function guarantees is that the
    engines are never handed a false `blocked` to explain.
