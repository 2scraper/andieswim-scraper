------------
Compare two andieswim-scraper runs by `sku` and report what moved.

    python3 diff_runs.py --old monday.json --new tuesday.json
    python3 diff_runs.py --old monday.json --new tuesday.json --fail-on-change

    added      a sku in the new run and not the old
    removed    a sku in the old run and not the new — which on this site
               means delisted or unpublished, OR simply outside this run's
               slice if the two runs did not cover the same pages. It does
               NOT mean "outside a site-imposed cap": this store caps
               nothing, so a listing run that reached the end of a
               collection holds all of it
    changed    a tracked field moved: price, currency, stock, or the
               product's own taxonomy
    source_changed
               the two rows were read a different way — a listing row and a
               `--mode product` variant row populate different columns — so
               the difference is about our two snapshots rather than about
               the product, and `--fail-on-change` ignores it (§8)

**Three things make two runs incomparable, and all three are refused rather
than diffed.** Each would otherwise produce a diff whose every line is an
artefact:

  * **different `mode`.** A listing run and a product run are different
    grains: a listing names a product once, a product run names each VARIANT.
  * **different `sort`.** On this store that should be impossible: the JSON
    endpoint takes no ordering and every row records `collection-default`.
    The guard is kept as a TRIPWIRE rather than for a live concern — if two
    files ever disagree here, something about how they were produced changed,
    and diffing them would compare two things made differently. (Contrast
    the sibling repo this code came from, where the ordering genuinely
    decides which products are in the file: page 1 of one category under two
    orderings shared 0 of 24 products.)
  * **different `locale`.** This store SETS its prices per market rather than
    converting them — one variant was 112.00 USD, 195.00 CAD, 110.00 GBP,
    175.00 AUD, 130.00 EUR and 21600 JPY on 2026-09-18 — so a cross-market
    diff reports a price change on essentially every row, and none of it is a
    price change. Compare markets deliberately, by joining on `sku` yourself,
    and read the numbers as two prices rather than as a movement. The join is
    exact here: the store is English everywhere, so titles are byte-identical
    across markets and only the money moves.

**`position` and `page` are deliberately not tracked.** They are a property
of the slice a run took, not of the product, and a run that shifts by one
page would otherwise report every row as changed.

# What is worth watching on a shop, and nothing else.
#
# This is a price monitor first: `price` and `currency` lead, and `price` is
# compared alongside `price_source` so a number that moved because it was
# read from a different NODE is not reported as a price change (see below).
#
# `in_stock` earns its place because it genuinely varies here — measured over
# 384 tiles, `available` on 377 and `soldout` on 7 — unlike the JSON-LD's own
# availability, which was InStock on 192 of 192 and would have made a
# constant column look like a monitored one.
#
# The taxonomy fields are tracked because a product moving collection, or
# gaining a special-edition flag, is a real editorial change worth seeing.
#
# Deliberately NOT tracked: `position` and `page` (a property of the slice,
# not of the product), `image_url` (the URL carries a content hash that
# changes when the site re-encodes an unchanged photo), and `title`, which is
# printed on every line anyway and whose whitespace the site is inconsistent
# about.

    # the point of the exercise
    "price", "original_price", "discount_pct", "currency", "in_stock",

    # swimwear catalogue, where 116 of 180 products are available in some

# The subset that ONLY one kind of run populates.
#
# A `--mode product` row is a VARIANT and a listing row is a PRODUCT, so the
# two populate different columns: only a variant row carries `color` and
# `size`, and only a listing row carries the collection it was walked from.
# Diffing one against the other would report every one of these as a change
# and none of it would be about the store. When the two rows disagree on
# `mode`, these are reported as `source_changed` rather than as changes —
# this family's rule (§8: a difference that comes with a provenance
# difference says something about our own two snapshots, not about the site).
#
# Note `sku` itself differs in KIND between the modes (a product id against a
# variant sku), which is why `diff_runs.py` refuses the comparison outright
# rather than relying on this list to clean it up.
