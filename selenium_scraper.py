andieswim-scraper — Selenium edition
====================================

Scrapes andieswim.com (Andie Swim): collection listings, keyword lookups,
and single products with their full size/colour table.

    --mode listing   (default)  /collections/{handle}   -> one row per PRODUCT
    --mode search               /search?q=...           -> one row per PRODUCT
    --mode product              /products/{handle}      -> one row per VARIANT,
                                                           each with its own
                                                           sku, size, colour,
                                                           price and stock

Three engines ship in this repo and they must agree on exit codes, run
status, and whether a run crashes or spends money; the shared decisions live
in output_writer.finish_run() and page_flow.py so they cannot drift apart.

What is different about Andie Swim
-----------------------------------
* **Nothing here is gated, at all.** Measured 2026-09-18 from a datacenter
  address: every route answered HTTP 200 with a browser User-Agent, with
  `curl/8.5.0`, with `python-urllib`, with a crawler UA, and with **no
  User-Agent header at all**. Twenty rapid requests: twenty 200s. No
  challenge has ever been observed. Say so plainly rather than selling a
  product nobody needs here (CLAUDE.md §13); the README lists what the paid
  products actually buy on this site, which is a specific MARKET and volume
  from many addresses, not access.

* **The data is JSON, and the HTML is not a fallback — it is empty.** A
  collection page's markup holds no product grid: 793 KB of
  `/collections/one-pieces` contains five `/products/` links, all from
  recommendation widgets, and `?page=2` returns the same five. The grid is
  painted after load by a React component over the Storefront API. A product
  page publishes one JSON-LD block and its `@type` is `BreadcrumbList` —
  there is no `Product` node anywhere. So this engine navigates to the
  store's OWN endpoints, which are ungated and richer than any rendered tile
  (§21: ask what the front end calls before assuming a browser).

* **A JSON document needs no readiness wait, and waiting on one is pure
  loss.** §8's three causes of missing content — unpainted, lazy-loaded, a
  different page served to this session — are all properties of a rendered
  page. `page_flow.wait_is_meaningful()` says so per URL, and the endpoint
  routes skip the wait rather than burning the whole budget to sample the
  same complete document twice.

* **A misspelt collection handle looks EXACTLY like an empty one.**
  `/collections/does-not-exist/products.json` answers HTTP 200 with
  `{"products": []}`; only the HTML route 404s. So a zero-row run checks the
  handle against the store's own collection index and says
  `unknown_collection` rather than `empty` when it is absent. Reporting a
  typo as a successfully-scraped empty category is the §20 failure this costs
  one request to avoid.

* **`products_count` is not a product count, so nothing is planned from it.**
  The collection index reports 472 for a collection the storefront serves 180
  of, and 3089 for one it serves 322 of — against 772 published products in
  the whole store. It reaches the sidecar as `catalog_count` with that
  warning and is used for nothing. The end of a listing is discovered from
  the data instead, and walking off the end is free: the page after the last
  one answers 200 with an empty array.

* **`--sort` does not exist here, and that is a measurement rather than an
  omission.** The JSON endpoint ignores `sort_by` — verified: the response is
  the same with and without it — so a flag would report an ordering the fetch
  never applied (§8). Unlike the sibling repo where ordering decides WHICH
  rows land in a capped file, nothing is capped here: a listing run fetches
  every published product in the collection, so ordering decides `position`
  and nothing else, and two runs under different orderings hold the same
  rows.

* **The market is a path prefix and the price is SET per market.** The
  store's own sitemap index lists 200 of them, all `en-xx`. The same variant
  on 2026-09-18: 112.00 USD, 195.00 CAD, 110.00 GBP, 175.00 AUD, 130.00 EUR,
  21600 JPY. 110 GBP is about 148 USD against a 112 USD list, so a
  cross-market gap is pricing policy and not arbitrage (§20). `--locale
  en-gb` selects one; every row carries which.

* **Currency is read from the site or left null.** The listing endpoint
  publishes no currency field, so this engine resolves it once per run — from
  a product document's `price_currency`, or from `Shopify.currency.active` in
  the market's own HTML — and writes `null` when it could read neither. It is
  never inferred from the market prefix, which would be a mapping this repo
  invented (§4, §8).

    listing parser handed a product document would otherwise emit one row
    whose `position` is 1 and whose page arithmetic was invented, and the run
    would look complete. `smoke_test.py` pins both directions (§20).

    They also disagree about a UNIT: `/products/{h}.js` prices in integer
    cents and every other route in a decimal string. Which one a payload is
    is detected from the payload rather than from the URL, because a
    `--dump-html` replay arrives without one, and reading either as the other
    is a factor of 100 in every price.

    `page_num` is threaded through rather than defaulted, because `position`
    restarts at 1 on every page: without the page number beside it, a row
    from page 2 claims the same position as one from page 1 and the two are
    indistinguishable in the output. `smoke_test.py` asserts page+position
    is unique across a multi-page run for exactly that reason.

    instead, and it was WRONG in a way that only running all three engines
    exposed: the three disagreed on the same URL, playwright and pyppeteer
    reporting USD where Selenium reported EUR.

    The cause is worth recording, because it is a property of the store and
    not of the engines. There is no HTTP redirect anywhere — `curl -L` on
    every route follows zero hops — but the theme ships a **client-side**
    geolocation app that rewrites the location to the visitor's own market
    after the page loads. Measured 2026-09-18 from a Finnish address:
    `/collections/all` snapshotted at `domcontentloaded` says
    `Shopify.currency.active = "USD"`, and the same URL under Selenium, which
    waits for the full load, ends at `/en-fi/collections/all` saying `"EUR"`.
    Same address, two answers, decided by how long the engine happened to
    wait.

    A JSON endpoint runs no JavaScript, so it cannot be redirected that way
    and all three engines get the identical answer. It is also the BETTER
    source on §4's ladder — `price_currency` is stated beside the price it
    belongs to, where `Shopify.currency` is a page-level fact one step
    removed.

    Leaves `currency` None if neither request answers, and says so. A run
